# Reinforcement Learning

Repo for Reinforcement Learning Specialization. Explored the power of adaptive learning systems and artificial intelligence (AI).Harnessing the full potential of artificial intelligence requires adaptive learning systems. Learnt how Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions help solve real-world problems through trial-and-error interaction by implementing a complete RL solution from beginning to end.

Through this specialization
* Built a Reinforcement Learning system for sequential decision making.
* Understand the space of RL algorithms (Temporal- Difference learning, Monte Carlo, Sarsa, Q-learning, Policy Gradients, Dyna, and more).
* Understand how to formalize your task as a Reinforcement Learning problem, and how to begin implementing a solution.
* Understand how RL fits under the broader umbrella of machine learning, and how it complements deep learning, supervised and unsupervised learning
