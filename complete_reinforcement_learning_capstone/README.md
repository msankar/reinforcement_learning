# A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone)

## Module 00: Welcome to the Course
Understand the prerequisites, goals and roadmap for the course.

### Milestone 01: Formalize Word Problem as MDP
Understand the state and action space
Understand the reward function that you need to implement.
Use the Lunar Lander environment

### Milestone 2: Choosing The Right Algorithm
Understand how to solve this MDP by deciding which of the many algorithms you have
learned about are a good fit for this problem.

### Milestone 3: Identify Key Performance Parameters
Discuss the meta-parameter choices that you will have to make to fully implement the agent.
Decide on the function approximator
Understand choices in the optimizer for updating the action-values and how to do exploration

### Milestone 4: Implement Your Agent
Understand how we will update our estimates of the action values.
Recall the details of the Adam algorithm.

#### Project Resources
Understand how to make your agent more sample efficient, when using function approximation. 
Recall the experience replay method, and how it relates to Dyna.

### Milestone 5: Submit Your Parameter Study!
Select appropriate meta-parameters
Implement a complete reinforcement learning system to land your module on the moon
